    description: "Dunhuang manuscripts are treasures among ancient Chinese texts. After the discovery of manuscript scrolls in the Dunhuang Library Cave in 1900, the long-hidden Dunhuang documents were scattered, and many complete manuscript scrolls were looted by foreign explorers. It wasn't until 1910 that the Qing Dynasty's Ministry of Education transported the remaining portions to Beijing.",

Those who copied sutras throughout history were mostly professional scribes, copyists, and monks skilled in writing. Some were hired, while others volunteered to copy. The primary focus when copying sutras was on the text itself, with accuracy being paramount.",

    title: "Lotus Sutra",

    description: "Tang dynasty calligraphy revered the 'Wang style.' The Dunhuang caves once housed copies of famous works such as Wang Xizhi's 'Zhan Jin Note' and 'Long Bao Note,' and Zhiyong's 'True and Cursive Thousand Character Classic Fragment.' Though few in number and fragmentary, they provide certain corroborating evidence. However, sutra calligraphy displays a distinct style in this contextâ€”focused on the text rather than emulating Wang's flowing style, it possesses a certain stern and powerful beauty. Based on excavated artifacts, Tang dynasty Dunhuang manuscripts generally feature elegant composition and vigorous brushwork.",
